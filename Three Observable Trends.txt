After finishing the Heroes of Pymoli homework I have found that these three trends exist:

1. Our target market of 20-24 year olds makes up about 44% of total users and 47% of total revenue. In order to make a more profitable game I believe we should market ourselves more to both the younger (14 and under) and older(30 plus) age ranges.
2. Males make up 83.5% of our total purchases yet Females and Others on average have a high total purchase per person. If we could increase those users its possible our avg total purchase per person would increase overall.
3. Higher priced items seem to be selling more frequently than lower priced items. Increasing our special high price items may lead to an increase in sales.
